This is a famous puzzle first proposed by Albert Einstein.  He proposed the 98% of the world cannot work this out.  I first came across this when I was 22.  It took me 4 days to figure it out very inefficently.  The ends justified the means :-)

Recently I was curious about using a test driven approach to solving the problem.  My theory was that a machine given the rules could show you the best solution.  I've always believed Albert Einstein was a brilliant man who could visualise a simple model to represent a complex thing.  After this exercise I believe he also had a sneaky sense of humor and that there may be a lot between the lines we have missed.

Who owns the fish?
==================

This is the question at the heart of this problem.  We are given 15 rules which describe the fixed state of a system.  From these 15 rules we are asked who owns the fish.

The system consists of 5 houses in a row.  Each house has the following properties { house_color, nationality, drink, pet, spport }.  For example the first house in the row could have the following properties.

```python
{
    'house_color': 'green',
    'nationality': 'irish', # obviously :-)
    'drink'      : 'water', # shame if you are surprised :-)
    'pet'        : 'horse',
    'sport'      : 'hurling' # look it up
}
```

For each of the 5 houses you must choose from the folling options.  Cigarette's were used when I first encountered this BUT they're plain wrong.

| Property    | Posibilities                                |
| ----------- |:------------------------------------------- |
| nationality | norweigan, german, danish, british, swedish |
| house_color | red, green, yellow, blue, white |
| drink | water, tea, coffee, beer, milk |
