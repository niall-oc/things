### FILL IN THE GRID PUZZLE

Objective: Arange the numbers 1 through 8 in the grid below.

        +---+---+
        |   |   |
    +---+---+---+---+
    |   |   |   |   |

RULES:
    No consecutive numbers may appear next to each other either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
    Each number may only be used once.
