### FILL IN THE GRID PUZZLE

Objective: Arange the numbers 1 through 8 in the grid below.

        +---+---+
        |   |   |
    +---+---+---+---+
    |   |   |   |   |

RULES:
    No consecutive numbers may appear next to each other either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
    Each number may only be used once.

    Recursive solution that uses a brute force approach to findindg the solution.

    2 essential facts are derived from the board state.
        - The number of empty spaces left.
        - The choice of numbers remaining.

    Solve for a given state
    The base case:
        If no there is no empty spaces the game is over so retrun the end state.
    The recursive case:
        While there are empty spaces, AND while there are choices remaining.
            If you can make a valid assignment,
                then assign the number to the board to create a new state.
                Solve for the new state. <------ Recursion, back to the top with a new step
            Else
                Try another number in this space.
                OR
                None of the numbers fit here so try them in another space.
    Everything failed
