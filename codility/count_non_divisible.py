You are given an array A consisting of N integers.

For each number A[i] such that 0 â‰¤ i < N, we want to count the number of elements 
of the array that are not the divisors of A[i]. We say that these elements are 
non-divisors.

For example, consider integer N = 5 and array A such that:
    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 3
    A[4] = 6

For the following elements:

        A[0] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
        A[1] = 1, the non-divisors are: 3, 2, 3, 6,
        A[2] = 2, the non-divisors are: 3, 3, 6,
        A[3] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
        A[4] = 6, there aren't any non-divisors.

Write a function:

    def solution(A)

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns a sequence of integers 
epresenting the amount of non-divisors.

Result array should be returned as an array of integers.

For example, given:
    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 3
    A[4] = 6

the function should return [2, 4, 3, 2, 0], as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

        N is an integer within the range [1..50,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..2 * N].
