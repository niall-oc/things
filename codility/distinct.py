Write a function

    class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of distinct values in array A.

For example, given array A consisting of six elements such that:
 A[0] = 2    A[1] = 1    A[2] = 1
 A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 1

the function should return 3, because there are 3 distinct values appearing in array A, namely 1, 2 and 3.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

        N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000,000..1,000,000].

import time


def solution_other(A):
    """
    Sort the array. Scan the array and only count everytime A[i] is greater than A[i-1]

    n = len(A)

    if not n: # base case for 0
        return n

    A.sort()
    distinct_count = 1 # the first number is distinct!
    for i in range(1, n):
        if A[i] > A[i-1]:
            distinct_count += 1

    return distinct_count
