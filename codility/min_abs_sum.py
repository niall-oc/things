For a given array A of N integers and a sequence S of N integers from the set
{−1, 1}, we define val(A, S) as follows:

val(A, S) = |sum{ A[i]*S[i] for i = 0..N−1 }|

(Assume that the sum of zero elements equals zero.)

For a given array A, we are looking for such a sequence S that minimizes val(A,S).

Write a function:

def solution(A)

that, given an array A of N integers, computes the minimum value of val(A,S)
from all possible values of val(A,S) for all possible sequences S of N integers
from the set {−1, 1}.

For example, given array:

  A[0] =  1
  A[1] =  5
  A[2] =  2
  A[3] = -2
your function should return 0, since for S = [−1, 1, −1, 1], val(A, S) = 0,
which is the minimum possible value.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [0..20,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−100..100].
